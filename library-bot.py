Even if this behavior occurs outside the server, it will absolutely NOT be tolerated. This is non-negotiable; his two lives are separate for his safety. Vel's Library can't be evicted if his landlord finds out he does porn and doesn't like it, but real world Vel can. \n\n2. **Be respectful. **You must respect all users, regardless of whether or not you like them personally. Do not shame anyone's kinks (or lack thereof), even if you don't share those interests yourself. No shaming or negative comments about ANY bodies/body types will be tolerated, even if they are directed toward yourself. \n\n3. **No discriminatory or hateful language. ** No slurs, excessive insults, derogatory terms, or hate speech are allowed. This includes intentional usage of incorrect pronouns and any other such harassing language toward any marginalized communities, as well as offensive display names or profile pictures. \n\n4. **No threats.** Threats (direct or indirect) to other users of DOXXING, violence, rape, death, abuse, and other malicious intent are absolutely prohibited and will result in immediate action. \n\n5. **No sexualizing each other without consent.** Do not sexualize, flirt, or comment on the bodies of any community members without obtaining consent first. While we can't monitor this actively, if it is brought to our attention that people are receiving unwanted attention/advances (real or in jest), it will be considered a violation unless unrevoked consent can be verified. \n\u200b"

This is both for your own privacy and to remove the potential for judgement or body shaming. This rule applies even to cropped pictures meant solely to showcase tattoos or piercings; however, we do permit photos of your nails in the fashion channel. \n\n7. **Keep conversations about audios focused on Vel.** Please save discussion of other VAs and their audios for those creators’ own community spaces or your private DMs. \n\n8. **No advertisements without authorization.** Please do not advertise for other creators. You may share your own creative work in appropriate channels provided it does not violate rule 6, but do not advertise your own commissionable services or solicit engagement for your own content. \n\n9. **No pornographic material outside of NSFW channels.** Porn and other adult/sexual material and discussions are only allowed in the appropriate age-restricted channels. \n\n10. **No AI.** The use of any of Vel's content in generative AI is strictly prohibited. \n\n11. **Listen to moderators.** If a moderator tags or DMs you in their official capacity, you are expected to address the message by replying and/or taking the action they recommended. Please refrain from blocking moderators. \n\n12. **No spoiling Vel’s content.** For recently released audios, please keep discussion in the https://discord.com/channels/1148449914188218399/1150656210341732393 channel and use [spoiler text](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/360022320632-Spoiler-Tags) as a courtesy.

The bot can pick a random audio with your favorite tags for you to listen to, you can search for audios by title or tags, and much more! Some example commands are listed below, or you can send the command `/tutorial` to learn the basics. You can also find the masterlist of all of Vel's audios [here](<https://airtable.com/apprrNWlCwDHYj4wW/shrb4mT61rtxVW04M/tblqwSpe5CdMuWHW6/viwM1D86nvAQFsCMr>). \n\nEnjoy your time in the library!")
